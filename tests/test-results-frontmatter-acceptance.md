# Test Results: Frontmatter Acceptance Criteria

**Date:** 2025-12-26
**Status:** Test plan created, manual execution pending

## Summary

This test plan validates the frontmatter-based acceptance criteria system. Tests require manual execution as they involve:
- Creating plans with writing-plans skill
- Running validation scripts
- Executing plans with executing-plans skill
- Verifying frontmatter updates

## Test Status

| Test | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Test 1: Generate Plan with Acceptance | Pending | Requires writing-plans skill invocation |
| Test 2: Validate Frontmatter Schema | Pending | Requires validation script execution |
| Test 3: Update Acceptance Status | Pending | Requires executing-plans workflow |
| Test 4: Verify Deprecation | Pending | Can be tested immediately |
| Test 5: Complete Workflow Integration | Pending | End-to-end workflow test |

## Next Steps

1. Run Test 4 (Verify Deprecation) - can be done immediately
2. Create a sample plan using writing-plans to execute Tests 1-2
3. Execute the sample plan using executing-plans for Test 3
4. Complete full workflow for Test 5

## Notes

- Tests 1-3 and 5 require actual plan creation and execution
- Test 4 can verify deprecation notices immediately
- Full integration test (Test 5) validates the complete system
- All tests should pass before considering feature complete
