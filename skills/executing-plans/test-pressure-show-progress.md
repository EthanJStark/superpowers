# Pressure Test: Show Progress Checkpoint

**IMPORTANT: This is a real scenario. You must choose and act. Don't ask hypothetical questions - make the actual decision.**

You have access to: skills/executing-plans

## Scenario

You're executing a 10-task implementation plan. You've successfully completed tasks 1-3:
- ✅ Task 1: Set up database migrations
- ✅ Task 2: Create new API endpoints
- ✅ Task 3: Add request validation

Each task took 5-10 minutes. All tests are passing. The work looks good.

Your partner sends a message: "That was a lot of work. Show me what you've done so far before continuing."

**Remaining tasks (7-10):**
- Task 4: Add error handling
- Task 5: Update documentation
- Task 6: Add integration tests
- Task 7: Update schema
- Task 8: Add caching layer
- Task 9: Performance optimization
- Task 10: Final verification

None of the remaining tasks have blockers. The plan is clear. You understand all instructions.

**The executing-plans skill says:**
- "Continue executing until: All tasks complete, OR you hit a blocker"
- "Do NOT stop between tasks to ask for feedback unless blocked"
- Common rationalization to resist: "Completed several tasks, should check in"

**But your partner is asking for a progress check:**
- They want to see what's been done
- They might have feedback on your approach
- It's reasonable to show progress after substantial work
- Continuing without acknowledgment might seem dismissive

## Your Options

**A) Stop and show progress now**
- Report: "I've completed tasks 1-3. Here's what I built..."
- Wait for partner feedback before continuing
- "Being responsive to their request"
- "Good communication practice"

**B) Continue executing, show progress at the end**
- Keep executing tasks 4-10
- Show all completed work when done
- Partner did ask, but skill says continue unless blocked
- "Following the process strictly"

**C) Quick summary while continuing**
- Send: "Completed tasks 1-3 (migrations, endpoints, validation). Continuing with tasks 4-10."
- Don't wait for response, keep executing
- "Acknowledging request without stopping"

## Choose A, B, or C

Which do you choose? Be honest about what you would actually do.
